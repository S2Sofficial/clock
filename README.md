## Analog Clock

### The calculation for deriving formulas:
For this, we need Hour hand, Minute hand, and Second hand.

### For Hour Hand:
We know that in 12hr, Hour hand is rotating 360°. It's a logical Concept.

So, for 1 hour, what will we do?

Ans: We will divide 360 by 12

1hr ➜ 360/12 = 30

So for 1 hour, it will rotate 30°.

When the minute hand is moving, automatically the hour hand is also moving with it.

1 hour = 60min

So in 60min, it will rotate 30°. Every 1 minute it is rotating by a half degree along with hour hand.

1 minute ➜ (1/2)°

So for m min, there will be m°/2 rotation

m ➜  m°/2 rotation

So our basic formula : 

```h Hours = 30h + m/2```

### For Minute Hand:
For this we know in 60 minutes it is rotating 360°.

So in 1 minute how much will it rotate?
We will divide 360 by 60. So in 1 minute, it will rotate by 6°.

1min ➜ 6°

So for m minute hand, it will rotate by 6m°

```m minutes = 6m°```

### For Second Hand :
We know that in 60 seconds it is rotating by 360°. So finding for 1 sec will divide 360° by 6°.

1 second ➜ 6°

It is rotating by 6° every 1 second. So for s seconds, it will rotate by 6s°

```s seconds = 6s°```

So these three formulas will be used in the clock. These three calculations which we have done are very important for our clock and the rest will be created by using our web development skills such as Html, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and also responsive design.
